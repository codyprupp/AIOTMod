This mod adds an "All In One Tool" (AIOT) to Minecraft 1.21!

The tool can be used as an axe, hoe, pickaxe, shovel, and sword! To craft it, you will need the 5 netherite tools that make up its functionality: the netherite axe, hoe, pickaxe, shovel, and sword (in no specific crafting shape). Future updates may include more integrated tools in the AIOT (such as shears or flint & steel), crafting tiers (wood, stone, diamond, etc.), and custom graphics.
